# Parallel Computing

Read the fundamentals first. They are the pages that exist. Everything under "Still to write" is the order the rest will be added: threads and OpenMP on one machine, MPI when the job spans a cluster, then CUDA, ROCm, OpenCL, and Vulkan.

Extra cores showed up because raising the clock got expensive. A GPU is a later machine for the same kind of problem, with a different programming model. The CPU pages come first so the GPU pages have something to compare against.

## Still to write

A line here turns into a link when that lesson is published.

### Why

- Why a parallel program is a different program
- [Concurrent, parallel, and distributed](concurrent-parallel-distributed.md)
### The machine you already have

- One core, made busier
- SIMD, MIMD, and the interconnect
- Shared memory versus distributed memory
- Cache coherence and false sharing
- Decomposition, tasks, and mapping
- Communication cost and granularity
- Speedup, efficiency, and scalability

### OpenMP and threads

OpenMP in this section is the CPU version. Offload to a device is listed with the GPU lessons.

- Pthreads: create, join, mutex, and barrier
- OpenMP regions, reductions, and loop-carried dependence
- OpenMP schedules
- OpenMP tasks and sections
- C++ atomics and memory order
- C++ parallel algorithms
- Thread pools, work stealing, and oneTBB

### A cluster

OpenMP ends at the node. MPI is the library the nodes use to talk.

- What a cluster is
- MPI send, receive, and matching
- Broadcast and reduction as a tree
- MPI collectives
- Overlap communication with computation
- Hybrid MPI and OpenMP

### 02 — CPU Shared-Memory Parallelism

### CUDA

- From the graphics pipeline to a processor you can program
- CUDA: host, device, and the copy
- CUDA grids, blocks, and threads
- CUDA memory spaces
- Coalescing and latency hiding
- Floating point on the device
- Decomposition for a GPU

### ROCm

- The ROCm stack
- HIP next to CUDA

### OpenCL, Vulkan, SYCL

- OpenCL next to CUDA
- Vulkan compute and SPIR-V
- SYCL
- OpenMP target offload

### After you have a number

- A profile, not a guess

### Same example, two machines

- Matrix-vector, by rows and by columns
- Odd-even transposition sort
- Parallel search, and speedup that lies
- n-body: all pairs and the reduced force
- FFT communication: exchange versus transpose
