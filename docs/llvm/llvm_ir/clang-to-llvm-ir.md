# How Clang Converts C/C++ Source Into LLVM IR

Most people think Clang "compiles C/C++ into machine code."
That is the wrong mental model.

Clang's first job is not performance. It is meaning. It decides what the source program actually means, then hands that meaning to LLVM, which decides how to make it run well on real hardware.

That is why the pipeline matters:

source code -> preprocessing -> parsing -> AST -> semantic analysis -> IR generation -> LLVM IR

Think of it like this:

- `Clang decides meaning`
- `LLVM decides performance and tuning`
- `LLVM IR is the contract between the two`

This split is why LLVM scales well. Clang understands the source language, while LLVM IR becomes the shared form that optimizers and backends can reuse.

## The Core Intuition

Use these as your shorthand when you read LLVM or debug compiler output:

1. **Clang is the language lawyer.** It checks whether the code is legal in the language you wrote.
2. **LLVM is the performance engineer.** It takes legal program meaning and reshapes it for the target machine.
3. **The AST is the source map.** It preserves source structure and language intent before lowering.
4. **LLVM IR is the executable contract.** It is detailed enough to optimize, but still abstract enough to retarget.

So the short version is simple: Clang decides what the program means, then LLVM decides how to make that meaning fast.

## What Clang Actually Uses Internally

When people say "Clang frontend", they usually mean a set of cooperating classes rather than one single compiler class.

The frontend is the part of Clang that understands source code and prepares it for LLVM. In practice, it is built from these components:

| Component | Main responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`clang::CompilerInstance`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CompilerInstance.html) | Owns the whole compilation state and wires the subsystems together |
| [`clang::FrontendAction`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1FrontendAction.html) | Chooses what the compiler should do, such as parse only, dump AST, or emit IR |
| [`clang::Preprocessor`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Preprocessor.html) | Expands `#include`, `#define`, and conditional compilation |
| [`clang::Lexer`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Lexer.html) | Converts raw characters into tokens |
| [`clang::Parser`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Parser.html) | Turns tokens into syntax structure and builds the AST |
| [`clang::Sema`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Sema.html) | Performs semantic checks like types, scopes, and overload resolution |
| [`clang::ASTContext`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ASTContext.html) | Stores AST-related type and declaration information |
| [`clang::ASTConsumer`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ASTConsumer.html) | Receives parsed declarations and AST events |
| [`clang::CodeGenAction`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CodeGenAction.html) | Lowers the validated AST to LLVM IR |
| [`clang::CodeGenModule`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CodeGen_1_1CodeGenModule.html) | Emits module-level IR structures |
| [`clang::CodeGenFunction`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CodeGen_1_1CodeGenFunction.html) | Emits function-level IR instructions |
| `llvm::Module` | Holds the generated LLVM IR module |
| `llvm::IRBuilder<>` | Convenience helper for building IR instructions |

You do not usually call these classes directly when using `clang` from the command line, but this is the object graph that makes the frontend work.

### Concrete Flow

If you run:

```bash
clang -S -emit-llvm demo.c -o demo.ll
```

the flow is roughly:

1. `CompilerInstance` creates and owns the compilation state.
2. `FrontendAction` decides that this run should emit LLVM IR.
3. `Preprocessor` expands macros and headers.
4. `Lexer` turns the rewritten character stream into tokens.
5. `Parser` consumes those tokens and builds syntax structure.
6. `Sema` checks types, scopes, and language rules while the AST is being formed.
7. `ASTContext` stores the type and declaration information that the rest of Clang needs.
8. `ASTConsumer` receives the parsed declarations and AST events.
9. `CodeGenAction` starts IR emission.
10. `CodeGenModule` and `CodeGenFunction` lower the AST into `llvm::Module` and instructions built with `llvm::IRBuilder<>`.

That is the concrete source-to-IR handoff. The command line looks simple, but under the hood it is a coordinated sequence of classes with clear responsibilities.

### Why This Matters for Debugging

For compiler engineers, this is the difference between a vague theory  and a debuggable system.

- If preprocessing is wrong, macros or include visibility are the problem.
- If parsing is wrong, you are looking at grammar or tokenization.
- If `Sema` is wrong, the source may be syntactically valid but semantically illegal.
- If IR looks surprising, the issue may already have happened before LLVM optimization even began.

That last point matters more than people admit. A lot of "LLVM bugs" are really frontend bugs, because the frontend already encoded a particular interpretation of the source.

## Where The Code Lives

Clang does not keep lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and lowering in one place. Each stage is split across focused files, and that is why the codebase is easier to navigate than a single monolithic compiler file.

## Frontend in 3 Core Stages

The short three-stage model is still the right mental frame, but Clang expands it into a real pipeline: preprocessing prepares the source, lexing turns it into tokens, parsing builds structure, `Sema` validates meaning, and code generation lowers that meaning into LLVM IR.

The tabs below map that model to the actual Clang files and show where each stage lives in the source tree.

## Algorithms Clang Uses

Clang is hand-written, not parser-generator driven. That matters because its algorithms are chosen for language complexity and compiler performance.


The frontend is not implemented in one giant file. Clang splits responsibility across focused `.cpp` files, and that is exactly what makes the frontend maintainable.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="lexing" label="Lexing / Preprocessing">

  Clang's lexer reads raw characters and turns them into tokens. It is the first stage that gives structure to source text.

  If you type:

  ```c
  int x = 42;
  ```

  the lexer does not think in terms of variables or assignments yet. It simply sees a stream of characters and breaks it into pieces like `int`, `x`, `=`, `42`, and `;`.

| Algorithm case | Main file(s) | What is implemented there |
|---|---|---|
| Token scanning | [`clang/lib/Lex/Lexer.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/Lexer.cpp) | Character-by-character tokenization, longest-match scanning, literal handling |
| Macro expansion | [`clang/lib/Lex/Preprocessor.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/Preprocessor.cpp), [`clang/lib/Lex/PPMacroExpansion.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/PPMacroExpansion.cpp) | `#define`, macro substitution, builtin macro expansion |
| Directive handling | [`clang/lib/Lex/PPDirectives.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/PPDirectives.cpp) | `#include`, `#if`, `#ifdef`, conditional compilation |
| Include lookup | [`clang/lib/Lex/HeaderSearch.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/HeaderSearch.cpp) | Header search paths and include resolution |

  **What to remember:** preprocessing rewrites source text first, then the lexer turns that rewritten text into tokens.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="parsing" label="Parsing / Grammar">

  Clang's parser is mostly hand-written recursive descent with precedence-aware expression parsing.

  In beginner terms, that means Clang does not use a giant parser-generator output file that mechanically follows a grammar table. Instead, the parser is written as real C++ functions that call each other.

  That gives Clang control over language features like C and C++ declarations, operator precedence, templates, and context-sensitive syntax.

  | Grammar area | Main file(s) | What is implemented there |
  |---|---|---|
| Top-level parser loop | [`clang/lib/Parse/Parser.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/Parser.cpp) | Dispatches declarations, statements, modules, Objective-C, and special top-level cases |
| Declaration grammar | [`clang/lib/Parse/ParseDecl.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/ParseDecl.cpp), [`clang/lib/Parse/ParseDeclCXX.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/ParseDeclCXX.cpp) | Declarators, specifiers, namespaces, templates, class members |
| Expression grammar | [`clang/lib/Parse/ParseExpr.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/ParseExpr.cpp) | Primary expressions, casts, postfix/prefix parsing, operator precedence handling |
| Statement grammar | [`clang/lib/Parse/ParseStmt.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/ParseStmt.cpp) | `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `return`, compound statements |
| C++-specific grammar | [`clang/lib/Parse/ParseCXX*.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang/lib/Parse) | Templates, classes, exceptions, inline methods, using-declarations |

  **What to remember:** the grammar is split across several parser files. `Parser.cpp` routes the work, and the `Parse*.cpp` files own the detailed grammar rules.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="sema" label="Semantic Analysis">

  Semantic analysis is where Clang checks whether the parsed program is valid according to the language rules.

  This is the stage where the compiler stops asking, "Does this look like code?" and starts asking, "Does this code make sense?"

  | Semantic area | Main file(s) | What is implemented there |
  |---|---|---|
| Sema driver | [`clang/lib/Sema/Sema.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/Sema.cpp) | Central semantic state and parser-to-sema handoff |
| Declaration checking | [`clang/lib/Sema/SemaDecl.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/SemaDecl.cpp) | Name binding, redeclarations, storage, linkage, function declarations |
| Expression checking | [`clang/lib/Sema/SemaExpr.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/SemaExpr.cpp) | Type checking, implicit conversions, lvalues/rvalues, expression validity |
| Statement checking | [`clang/lib/Sema/SemaStmt.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/SemaStmt.cpp) | Condition checks, control-flow legality, statement-level validation |
| Overload resolution | [`clang/lib/Sema/SemaOverload.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/SemaOverload.cpp) | C++ overload selection, candidate ranking, implicit conversion ranking |
| Type semantics | [`clang/lib/Sema/SemaType.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Sema/SemaType.cpp) | Type construction, qualifiers, pointers, arrays, function types |

  **What to remember:** parsing proves the code is shaped correctly; `Sema` proves the code means something valid in the language.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="codegen" label="IR Generation">

  Once the program is valid, Clang lowers the AST into LLVM IR. This is the handoff point between language meaning and machine optimization.

| Lowering area | Main file(s) | What is implemented there |
|---|---|---|
| Module lowering | [`clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenModule.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenModule.cpp) | Global variables, functions, module-level metadata, target layout |
| Function lowering | [`clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenFunction.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenFunction.cpp) | Statements, branches, local variables, control flow, return paths |
| Expression lowering | [`clang/lib/CodeGen/CGExpr.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGExpr.cpp) | Arithmetic, loads/stores, casts, calls, address computation |
| Statement lowering | [`clang/lib/CodeGen/CGStmt.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGStmt.cpp) | `if`, loops, switches, blocks, structured control flow |
| Action wiring | [`clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenAction.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/CodeGen/CodeGenAction.cpp) | Connects AST consumer output to IR emission |

  **What to remember:** this is the lowering step where validated source meaning becomes LLVM IR instructions.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Why This Matters for Lowering

This is where frontend decisions start affecting backend quality.

- A cleaner IR shape often leads to better optimization.
- Bad lowering can hide optimization opportunities before `instcombine`, `simplifycfg`, or inlining even run.
- On GPU targets, the frontend choices can affect address spaces, calling conventions, and how aggressively the backend can map work to the hardware.

That is why frontend quality is not a "syntax only" concern. It directly influences throughput, code size, and target-specific code generation.

## Walkthrough: One C Function, Real IR

Here is a concrete example compiled on this machine with `clang 18.1.3` at `-O0`.

Source:

```c
int sum_to_n(int n) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Command:

```python
clang -S -emit-llvm -O0 /tmp/clang_walkthrough.c -o /tmp/clang_walkthrough.ll
```

Relevant LLVM IR:

```llvm
define dso_local i32 @sum_to_n(i32 noundef %0) #0 {
  %2 = alloca i32, align 4
  %3 = alloca i32, align 4
  %4 = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %0, ptr %2, align 4
  store i32 0, ptr %3, align 4
  store i32 1, ptr %4, align 4
  br label %5

5:
  %6 = load i32, ptr %4, align 4
  %7 = load i32, ptr %2, align 4
  %8 = icmp sle i32 %6, %7
  br i1 %8, label %9, label %16

9:
  %10 = load i32, ptr %4, align 4
  %11 = load i32, ptr %3, align 4
  %12 = add nsw i32 %11, %10
  store i32 %12, ptr %3, align 4
  br label %13

13:
  %14 = load i32, ptr %4, align 4
  %15 = add nsw i32 %14, 1
  store i32 %15, ptr %4, align 4
  br label %5, !llvm.loop !6

16:
  %17 = load i32, ptr %3, align 4
  ret i32 %17
}
```

This example proves the earlier point very directly:

- The source-level loop becomes basic blocks `5`, `9`, `13`, and `16`.
- The comparison `i <= n` becomes `icmp sle`.
- The loop branch becomes `br i1 %8, label %9, label %16`.
- The local variables are first represented as stack slots with `alloca` because `-O0` preserves source structure.
- The function is marked `optnone`, which is why Clang does not aggressively simplify it at this stage.

That is the frontend contract in action. Clang did not decide how to optimize the loop. It decided what the loop means, then emitted a precise IR form that LLVM can later transform.

## What Changes the IR Output

The LLVM IR Clang emits is shaped by several inputs:

- the source language mode, such as `C`, `C++17`, or `C++20`
- the optimization level, such as `-O0` or `-O2`
- the target triple and CPU features
- debug info flags like `-g`
- ABI rules, calling conventions, and data layout

This is why the same source file can produce different IR depending on build flags.

### Example

```bash
clang -S -emit-llvm -O0 hello.c -o hello-O0.ll
clang -S -emit-llvm -O2 hello.c -o hello-O2.ll
```

At `-O0`, Clang keeps the IR closer to the source structure.
At higher optimization levels, more canonicalization and simplification can appear earlier in the pipeline.

### Real-world implication

Two source files that look similar can produce very different IR quality if their frontend-lowering paths differ.

That shows up as:

- different vectorization opportunities
- different inlining behavior
- different register pressure later in the backend
- different GPU occupancy or memory traffic on accelerator targets

If you are debugging performance, read the IR before blaming the backend.

## C vs C++

Clang handles both languages, but C++ usually produces more complex IR because the frontend must represent more language machinery.

Here is the same function compiled as C and as C++ on this machine at `-O0`:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

```c++
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

The C output starts like this:

```llvm
define dso_local i32 @add(i32 noundef %0, i32 noundef %1) #0 {
  %3 = alloca i32, align 4
  %4 = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %0, ptr %3, align 4
  store i32 %1, ptr %4, align 4
  %5 = load i32, ptr %3, align 4
  %6 = load i32, ptr %4, align 4
  %7 = add nsw i32 %5, %6
  ret i32 %7
}
```

The C++ output starts like this:

```llvm
define dso_local noundef i32 @_Z3addii(i32 noundef %0, i32 noundef %1) #0 {
  %3 = alloca i32, align 4
  %4 = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %0, ptr %3, align 4
  store i32 %1, ptr %4, align 4
  %5 = load i32, ptr %3, align 4
  %6 = load i32, ptr %4, align 4
  %7 = add nsw i32 %5, %6
  ret i32 %7
}
```

What changed?

- The arithmetic lowering is the same.
- The symbol name is mangled in C++ (`@add` vs `@_Z3addii`).
- C++ carries more language machinery, so the frontend has more work before LLVM ever sees the IR.

### C usually involves:

- straightforward functions
- primitive types
- simple control flow
- fewer frontend-driven abstractions

### C++ usually adds:

- name mangling
- constructors and destructors
- virtual tables
- exception handling support
- templates and instantiations
- references and richer type semantics

That is why a simple C++ source file often turns into more IR than an equivalent C file.

## How To Inspect Each Stage Yourself

If you want to see what Clang is doing, use the stages directly on the same source file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define SCALE 4

int main(void) {
  int x = SCALE;
  printf("%d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="tokens" label="Tokens">

  ```bash
  clang -Xclang -dump-tokens -fsyntax-only demo.c
  ```

  This shows the token stream after lexing.

  Look for:
  - keywords like `int`
  - identifiers like `main`
  - punctuation like `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`
  - operators like `=`
  - literals like `4`

  Tokens are the bridge between raw source text and the parser. If tokenization is wrong, the parser never gets a clean input stream.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="preprocessor" label="Preprocessor">

  ```bash
  clang -E demo.c
  ```

  This shows the source after macro expansion and header inclusion.

  Look for:
  - expanded `#include` content
  - replaced macros like `SCALE`
  - the exact text Clang will hand to the parser

  If this output is surprising, the problem is often in preprocessing, not in parsing or LLVM.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ast" label="AST">

  ```bash
  clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only demo.c
  ```

  This shows the program structure as Clang understands it.

  Look for:
  - declarations
  - statements
  - expressions
  - how Clang grouped the source into syntax nodes

  If the AST looks wrong, the problem is usually in parsing or semantic analysis.

  We will go deeper into ASTs, tokens, and the full frontend flow in upcoming articles, because each one deserves its own focused walkthrough.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ir" label="LLVM IR">

  ```bash
  clang -S -emit-llvm demo.c -o demo.ll
  ```

  This shows the lowered LLVM IR.

  Look for:
  - functions and basic blocks
  - `call`, `br`, `add`, `icmp`, and similar instructions
  - stack slots, loads, and stores at `-O0`

  This is the boundary where Clang stops reasoning about source syntax and starts expressing program meaning in LLVM form.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="optimized" label="Optimized IR">

  ```bash
  clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm demo.c -o demo-O2.ll
  ```

  This shows how optimization changes the IR shape.

  Look for:
  - simpler control flow
  - eliminated temporary values
  - different loop structure
  - more canonicalized IR

  This is useful when you want to compare frontend lowering against optimized output.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For systems and compiler engineers, this is the practical debugging loop:

1. Check `clang -Xclang -dump-tokens -fsyntax-only` when tokenization looks wrong.
2. Check `clang -E` when macros or includes look wrong.
3. Check `clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only` when syntax or meaning looks wrong.
4. Check `clang -S -emit-llvm` when lowering or performance looks wrong.
5. Check `clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm` when you want to see optimizer impact.

## Why This Matters

Understanding Clang's lowering step makes the rest of LLVM easier:

- LLVM IR becomes less mysterious once you know where it comes from
- optimization passes are easier to understand when you know the AST-to-IR boundary
- backend lowering makes more sense once you see that the frontend already encoded language semantics into IR

If you understand that boundary, you can usually tell whether a problem belongs to source semantics, IR shaping, or backend code generation.

## Conclusion

Concrete version:

1. Clang reads your source file and expands macros and headers.
2. The lexer turns characters into tokens.
3. The parser turns tokens into structure.
4. `Sema` checks whether the code actually means something legal in the language.
5. Clang lowers that validated meaning into LLVM IR.
6. LLVM then optimizes that IR and turns it into machine code for the target.

That is why Clang is not just "the compiler frontend." It is the stage that decides the program shape LLVM will inherit.
If the frontend gets the shape wrong, LLVM can still optimize, but it starts from the wrong input.

So when you debug performance, GPU lowering, or backend behavior, the first question is usually not "what did assembly do?"
The first question is "what did Clang hand to LLVM?"

## FAQ

**What is Clang frontend in LLVM?**

Clang frontend is the source-to-IR part of the compiler. See [What Clang Actually Uses Internally](#what-clang-actually-uses-internally) for the real Clang components and [Algorithms Clang Uses](#algorithms-clang-uses) for how they map to files and stages.

**Is Clang just a parser?**

No. Parsing is only one part of it. See [Frontend in 3 Core Stages](#frontend-in-3-core-stages) and [What Clang Actually Uses Internally](#what-clang-actually-uses-internally) for the full path from source text to LLVM IR.

**What file handles tokenization in Clang?**

The main lexer logic lives in [`clang/lib/Lex/Lexer.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Lex/Lexer.cpp). Preprocessing and macro handling live in the other Lex files linked above.

**Where does Clang build the AST?**

The parser and semantic analysis cooperate to build and validate the AST. The parser files live under `clang/lib/Parse/`, and the semantic checks live under `clang/lib/Sema/`.

**Why should compiler and GPU engineers care about the frontend?**

Because frontend lowering affects IR quality, optimization opportunities, calling conventions, address spaces, and eventually backend performance on CPUs and GPUs.

**Where can I learn the full LLVM pipeline?**

Start with the [LLVM Architecture Overview](/docs/llvm/llvm_basic/LLVM_Architecture) and the [LLVM Roadmap](/docs/llvm/). Those pages show the broader source-to-IR-to-backend flow.

**What is the difference between `clang -E` and `clang -S -emit-llvm`?**

`clang -E` shows the preprocessed source after macros and includes are expanded. `clang -S -emit-llvm` shows the LLVM IR that Clang generates after parsing, semantic analysis, and lowering.

**What is the difference between tokens and AST?**

Tokens are the lexical pieces of source text, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. The AST is the structured representation built from those tokens after parsing.

**Why does `-O0` produce more stack variables in LLVM IR?**

At `-O0`, Clang keeps the IR closer to the source structure, so local variables often appear as `alloca`, `load`, and `store` instructions before optimization simplifies them.

**Why does Clang use `Sema` instead of putting everything in the parser?**

The parser is responsible for syntax. `Sema` handles meaning, type rules, overload resolution, and other language checks that are easier to enforce after syntax has been recognized.

## Practice After Reading

If you want to test yourself after reading this article, move to the broader LLVM learning path and the MCQ track:

- [Clang Frontend MCQs Quiz](https://www.compilersutra.com/docs/mcq/questions/domain/compilers/llvm/clang-frontend-quiz)
- [LLVM MCQs Quiz](https://www.compilersutra.com/docs/mcq/questions/domain/compilers/llvm/quiz)
- [LLVM Track Home](https://www.compilersutra.com/docs/mcq/questions/domain/compilers/llvm)
- [LLVM Architecture Overview](/docs/llvm/llvm_basic/LLVM_Architecture)

Read the article first, then try the quiz without looking back at the text. That is the fastest way to find the gaps in your mental model.

## Summary

Clang turns source into meaning; LLVM turns that meaning into performance.

That is the boundary to remember when you read IR, debug compiler behavior, or reason about backend output.
