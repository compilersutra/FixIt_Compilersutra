## 0. Abstract

This article compares Rust and modern C++ on one concrete system: a concurrent in-memory cache with a background eviction thread. It measures the kinds of failures that matter in native code, not raw speed: [use-after-free](#4-use-after-free), [buffer overflow](#5-buffer-overflow), [null pointer dereference](#6-null-pointer-dereference), and [data races](#7-data-race). For each case, it shows the bug in traditional C++, the kind of signal a sanitizer can give you, the modern C++ fix, and the Rust shape that often prevents the bug from compiling in safe code. The article does not claim that Rust eliminates all bugs, that modern C++ cannot be made safer, or that one language always wins. It is meant to help the reader decide when compile-time enforcement is worth the migration cost, when toolchain hardening is enough, and when the safer default should be a language choice rather than a build flag.

## 1. Why This Comparison Matters Now

Memory safety is not a niche concern. Microsoft has said roughly 70% of the CVEs it assigns each year are memory-safety issues [Microsoft MSRC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2019/07/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/). Chromium reports that around 70% of its serious security bugs are memory-safety problems, and says a large share of those are use-after-free bugs [Chromium memory safety](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety).

Google and Android have made the same strategic shift. Android’s memory-safety documentation says native code written in C, C++, and assembly is a major part of the platform’s vulnerability surface [Android memory safety](https://source.android.com/docs/security/test/memory-safety). Google also documented its use of Rust for new Android native code as a memory-safe alternative to C/C++ [Android 13 Rust update](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html).

That is the context for this comparison. The question is not whether C++ can be written carefully. The question is whether modern C++ plus tooling gives you the same failure-prevention model as Rust in practice.

:::note
Memory safety means that loads, stores, and pointer operations stay within the rules the language can define and verify. Managed languages usually get there with automatic memory management, but systems languages often avoid a heavy runtime like a garbage collector, so they recover safety through ownership rules, safer APIs, and tooling instead.
:::

## 2. Why Undefined Behavior Exists in C++

Undefined behavior is not an accident. It is part of how C and C++ keep low-level code fast and expressive. If the compiler has to assume that every pointer may be invalid, every integer may overflow, and every alias may exist, it loses room for optimization. UB gives the optimizer stronger assumptions.

A simple example is enough to show the idea:

```cpp
int safe_increment(int x) {
  return x + 1;
}

bool is_increasing(int x) {
  return x + 1 > x;
}
```

If `x` is `INT_MAX`, then `x + 1` overflows, which is undefined behavior. The compiler is allowed to assume the overflow case does not happen. Under that assumption, `x + 1 > x` can be treated as always true. A debug build may appear to work while an optimized build folds the comparison away.

The same general rule is what makes pointer-based code tricky. Once the program steps outside the language rules, the optimizer is allowed to make aggressive choices. This is why modern C++ safety is not just about syntax; it is also about using APIs and tooling that keep the program inside defined behavior.

:::note
This is the real cost model behind C++: performance headroom comes from strong compiler assumptions, and safety has to be rebuilt with library design, guidelines, and tools.
:::

## 3. Running Example: A Concurrent In-Memory Cache

We use one cache throughout: a key-value store with expiration and a background eviction thread.

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="language">
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <unordered_map>

struct Entry {
  std::string value;
  std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point expires_at;
};

class Cache {
 public:
  void put(std::string key, std::string value);
  std::string* get(const std::string& key);
  void evict_expired();

 private:
  std::mutex mu_;
  std::unordered_map<std::string, Entry> map_;
  bool stop_ = false;
  std::thread evictor_;
};
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::time::Instant;

struct Entry {
    value: String,
    expires_at: Instant,
}

struct Cache {
    map: Mutex<HashMap<String, Entry>>,
    stop: std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool,
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is a good comparison vehicle because it naturally exercises the failures that matter in systems code:

- ownership confusion when cache entries are handed out
- invalidation when eviction runs in the background
- iterator and reference lifetime problems
- unsynchronized shared state across threads

The cache declaration shows an `evictor_` thread because the full lifecycle matters here. The constructor and destructor plumbing are omitted in this snippet for readability, but later examples show the thread start/join path explicitly.

:::note
Iterator invalidation is a real C++ footgun: if you mutate a container while holding an iterator or reference into it, the iterator can become invalid. Rust prevents that class of bug by refusing to let you mutate through one alias while another live borrow still exists.

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
auto it = v.begin();
v.push_back(4);  // it may now be invalid
std::cout << *it;  // undefined behavior
```
:::

Modern C++ also has better non-owning types for APIs, including `std::span` and `std::string_view`, which make ownership and size more explicit. That helps, but it does not change the fact that C++ still relies on the programmer to keep the lifetime and threading rules intact.

:::note
The rest of the article keeps returning to this same cache so the comparison stays concrete instead of drifting into abstract language theory.
:::

## 4. Use-After-Free

We are trying to show how a pointer can outlive the storage it points to, why that becomes a security bug, how ASan catches it at runtime, how modern C++ can reduce the risk with ownership types, and why Rust turns the lifetime mistake into a compile-time error in safe code.

<Tabs groupId="uaf-steps-1" queryString="uaf-steps-1">
  <TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1: Break it">

The classic use-after-free mistake is keeping a pointer after the backing storage has been deleted or otherwise invalidated. The code still compiles, and the pointer still has a value, but the object it points to is no longer alive. Reading through that pointer is undefined behavior.

```cpp
int* p = new int[4]{1, 2, 3, 4};
delete[] p;
std::cout << p[2] << "\n";  // use-after-free
```

This compiles cleanly. The bug appears later when the freed memory is read.

### Memory Leak vs Use-After-Free

A memory leak is memory that was allocated but is no longer reachable, so the program can no longer free it or reuse it. The process may keep running, but its memory usage grows over time. That is different from use-after-free: in a leak the memory is still allocated, while in use-after-free the program keeps touching memory after it has already been freed.

A tiny example:

```cpp
int* p = new int(42);
p = nullptr;  // leak: the allocated int is now unreachable
```

```text
allocated object --> p --> overwritten
        |
        └── no live pointer left, so the allocation leaks
```

Leaking memory is usually not an immediate crash, but it can still become a security and reliability issue. In a server, a leak can slowly consume memory until the process is killed or becomes unstable. In a long-running service, that can become a denial-of-service problem.

    }
}

  </TabItem>

That is better, but it is not free of failure modes. A `shared_ptr` cycle leaks memory, and sanitizers do not prove ownership correctness.

`shared_ptr` can prevent dangling references and still leave you with a memory leak if the ownership graph has a cycle.

## 5. Buffer Overflow

We are trying to show how a single out-of-bounds write can corrupt nearby memory, why ASan catches it at runtime, how modern C++ can reduce the risk with checked containers and spans, and how Rust makes the safe path explicit through slices and bounds checks.

  write_slot(buf, 4);

Rust keeps the safe path explicit. Direct indexing on a slice can panic at runtime, while `get_mut` returns an `Option` that the caller must handle. For example:

```rust
let mut buf = [b'a', b'b', b'c', 0];
println!("{:?}", buf.get_mut(4)); // None

## 6. Null Pointer Dereference

We are trying to show how a null pointer dereference reaches a crash, why the crash is usually immediate, how modern C++ can make absence explicit with `std::optional`, and how Rust forces `Option<T>` handling before the code compiles cleanly.

<Tabs groupId="null-steps" queryString="null-steps">

const std::string* find_user(Cache& cache, const std::string& key) {

This bug is simple in shape but common in practice: the dereference site is valid syntax, yet the pointer itself is not valid at runtime.

This crash trace points directly to the dereference site. The immediate fix is to check for null before dereferencing. A better long-term fix is to redesign the API so absence is explicit with `std::optional` in C++ or `Option<T>` in Rust.

This is better API design, but it is still a design decision. C++ does not force the caller to deal with absence unless you expose absence explicitly.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="step4" label="Step 4: Rust's answer">

Rust keeps the absence case explicit at the call site. In practice, that means the compiler pushes you toward a `match`, `if let`, or `?`-based path instead of letting the code silently assume the value exists. For example:

```rust
match get_value() {
    Some(v) => println!("{}", v),
    None => println!("missing"),
}

## 7. Data Race

We are trying to show how two threads can mutate shared state at the same time, why TSan catches the race only when it is enabled, how modern C++ fixes it with explicit locking, and how Rust constrains sharing rules with `Send` and `Sync`.

<Tabs groupId="race-steps" queryString="race-steps">
  <TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1: Break it">

```cpp
int hits = 0;

void record_hit() {
  ++hits;  // no synchronization
}
```

In the cache, the same bug shows up when eviction, reads, and writes touch the same state without a lock.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="step2" label="Step 2: Observe it">

TSan reports the race only when you run with TSan enabled. Actual local output:

```bash

## 8. Unsafe Escape Hatches

Rust is not "no unsafe code." It is "safe code by default, unsafe only where needed."

The Rust Book says `unsafe` allows five things that safe Rust does not, including dereferencing raw pointers and calling unsafe functions [Rust Book: Unsafe Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-01-unsafe-rust.html). The Rust Reference says unsafe code is where the compiler cannot prove the safety contract itself [Rust Reference: unsafe keyword](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/unsafe-keyword.html).

A small practical example is enough:

<Tabs groupId="unsafe-example" queryString="unsafe-example">
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
int read_first(const int* ptr) {
  return *ptr;
}
```

C++ lets the raw pointer stay in the normal language surface. If `ptr` is invalid, null, or dangling, the bug is still there.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
fn read_first(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {
    unsafe {
        // We promise ptr is valid, aligned, and points to initialized memory.
        *ptr
    }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That code is not automatically wrong. It is wrong if the safety contract is false. The point of `unsafe` is to make that contract explicit and localized.

That is the honest comparison:

- Rust safe code versus the specific `unsafe` boundary
- modern C++ versus the entire language and library surface

The C++ Core Guidelines take a different route. They recommend RAII, non-owning raw pointers for interfaces only, and `unique_ptr` over `shared_ptr` unless sharing is truly needed [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/). That is good guidance, but it remains guidance. The compiler does not enforce it.

:::note
This is where the practical difference becomes clearest. Rust narrows the unsafe surface. C++ asks teams to manage it.
:::

## Where the Borrow Checker Hurts

Not every pattern fits Rust's ownership model. A doubly-linked list or graph with back-references is the classic example.

<Tabs groupId="borrow-pain" queryString="borrow-pain">
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++ (straightforward)">

```cpp
struct Node {
    int value;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
};
// Works directly, but lifecycle management is manual.
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust (painful)">

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    prev: *mut Node,  // raw pointer
    next: *mut Node,  // raw pointer
}
// This pushes the module toward unsafe for mutation-heavy operations.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Rust workarounds each have costs:

| Approach | Cost |
|---|---|
| Indices (`Vec` + indices instead of pointers) | Runtime bounds checks, indirect access |
| `Rc<RefCell<T>>` | Reference counting, runtime borrow checks, possible panics |
| `unsafe` + raw pointers | You lose Rust's safety guarantees in that module |
| Arena allocator | More complex design, still needs careful lifetime management |

The honest take: for graphs, linked structures, and self-referential types, Rust often forces a redesign or an `unsafe` boundary. C++ lets you write the obvious pointer code immediately, but then the safety verification sits with you.

## Common Myths

| Myth | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Rust has no unsafe code" | `unsafe` exists and is used in the standard library, including low-level collection internals. |
| "Modern C++ has no memory bugs" | Smart pointers help, but use-after-free, races, and iterator invalidation still exist. |
| "Rust is always faster than C++" | Often close, but bounds checks and lock contention can change the result. |
| "C++ can't be memory safe" | With sanitizers, fuzzing, and discipline, it can be very safe, just not provably so by default. |
| "Rust eliminates all crashes" | Rust programs can still panic on out-of-bounds indexing or `None` unwraps. |

## 9. Toolchain Stack and Safety Profiles

| Concern | C++ tool | Default? | Rust mechanism | Default? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Use-after-free | AddressSanitizer | No, opt-in | Borrow checker | Yes |
| Data race | ThreadSanitizer | No, opt-in | `Send` / `Sync` | Yes |
| UB detection | UBSan | No, opt-in | Language design | Yes |
| Buffer overflow | ASan / `.at()` / `std::span` | No, opt-in | Bounds checks | Yes |
| Null deref | Static analysis | No, opt-in | `Option<T>` | Yes |
| Coding style | clang-tidy, Core Guidelines, banned APIs | No, opt-in | clippy | Optional |

<Tabs groupId="toolchain-stack" queryString="toolchain-stack">
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```bash
clang++ -O2 -Wall -Wextra cache.cpp
clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefined -g cache.cpp
clang++ -fsanitize=thread -g cache.cpp

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```bash

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The C++ stack is strong, but it is not the default. Rust’s core safety model is.

## 10. Safety in Large C++ Codebases

Modern C++ safety at scale is not just about one compiler flag. Large codebases usually combine multiple layers:

- sanitizers in CI
- fuzzing with libFuzzer or OSS-Fuzz
- static analysis with clang-tidy or commercial tools
- code review rules that ban raw ownership by default
- API policies that prefer `span`, `string_view`, `optional`, `unique_ptr`, and `not_null`-style wrappers where appropriate

That is the real production story. A disciplined C++ team can be very safe, but the safety posture comes from process plus tooling, not from the language default alone.

Rust teams still use CI, fuzzing, and tests, but the compiler removes a large class of memory errors before those tools need to find them.

:::caution
A strong C++ safety program is real engineering work. It is not a shortcut, and it is not free.
:::

## 11. Aggregate Summary

| Experiment | Traditional C++ | Modern C++ | C++ + Sanitizers | Rust |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Use-after-free | Silent UB | Partial | Runtime catch | Compile-time reject |
| Buffer overflow | Silent UB | Better with checked APIs | Runtime catch | Runtime panic or compile-time-shape rejection |
| Null deref | Crash or UB | Better with `optional` | Runtime catch | Compile-time handling of `Option` |
| Data race | Silent corruption | Convention-based | Runtime catch with TSan | Compile-time reject |

## 12. Benchmark Methodology

This comparison should be read like an engineering note, not a universal benchmark.

:::note
The example logs below were captured locally on this machine. The quoted sanitizer overhead numbers come from the published papers, because the local runs in this article are about correctness and reproducibility of the failure modes, not a controlled benchmark campaign.
:::

The local commands used to capture the example output were:

- `clang++ -fsanitize=address -g /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/uaf2.cpp -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/uaf2_asan && /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/uaf2_asan`
- `clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefined -g /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/overflow.cpp -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/overflow_san && /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/overflow_san`
- `clang++ -fsanitize=thread -g /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/race.cpp -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/race_tsan && /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/race_tsan`
- `rustc /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/borrow.rs -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_demo/borrow_bin`

Published baseline figures from the sanitizer literature are useful context:

- AddressSanitizer reports an average slowdown of 73% on SPEC CPU2006 and average memory usage increase of 3.37x in the paper [AddressSanitizer paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final39.pdf)
- ThreadSanitizer reports a memory overhead of about 3x to 4x on average Google unit tests and an average slowdown under 30x compared to native runs in the paper [ThreadSanitizer paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/35604.pdf)

Limitations:

- synthetic workload
- one machine
- not representative of all access patterns
- not a throughput or latency study
- the exact runtime overhead of sanitizers depends heavily on workload and build flags

:::caution
Do not overgeneralize the numbers from tiny examples into claims about whole codebases.
:::

## 13. Local Performance Snapshot

This is a local throughput snapshot from the same cache shape used throughout the article. It is intentionally narrow: 1,000,000 total cache lookups, 8 reader threads, 1 eviction thread, and 5 repetitions averaged on this machine.

The benchmark binaries were compiled locally with:

- `clang++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -std=c++20 -pthread /tmp/cs_memsafe_perf/cache_bench.cpp -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_perf/cache_bench_cpp`
- `rustc -O /tmp/cs_memsafe_perf/cache_bench.rs -o /tmp/cs_memsafe_perf/cache_bench_rust`

The measured outputs were:

| Metric | C++ | Rust | Delta | Reproducibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Average wall time | 0.0794 s | 0.1034 s | Rust was 30.1% slower in this run | This machine only |
| Throughput | 12.59 million ops/sec | 9.67 million ops/sec | C++ was 30.1% faster in this run | This machine only |
| Stripped binary size | 23,088 bytes | 421,240 bytes | C++ binary was smaller in this build | Linkage and packaging differ |

:::danger
Do not generalize this single number. This is one mutex-heavy workload on one machine. Real-world performance varies by workload, optimization flags, implementation choices, and build strategy. Run your own benchmarks for your use case.
:::

That is not a universal verdict. It is a local snapshot of one mutex-heavy cache implementation under one build configuration. The point is to show the cost of the same workload shape, not to declare a winner for all systems code. Rust's larger binary reflects static linking of the standard library; size-optimized builds with `lto = true` and `opt-level = "z"` produce significantly smaller outputs. The binary-size gap here is mostly a build artifact, while the C++ build is smaller in this environment.

## 14. Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommendation | Risk if you get it wrong | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| New greenfield system, performance-critical, long maintenance horizon | Rust | Late-stage memory-safety bug or future CVE | Borrow checker catches bugs that often appear in year 2 or 3 |
| Large existing C++ codebase, experienced C++ team | Modern C++ + sanitizers + clang-tidy | Silent corruption if tooling is skipped | Migration cost may be too high; harden what exists |
| Safety-critical / regulated industry | Evaluate toolchain and certification requirements | Audit failure or non-compliant deployment | MISRA C++, SPARK Ada, or Rust may fit depending on constraints |
| Team new to systems programming, with mentorship | Rust | Developer friction during onboarding | The compiler rejects bad patterns early and teaches the model of ownership |
| Team new to systems programming, without mentorship | Small project first, either language | Both languages can be unforgiving without guidance | Start with a narrow scope and a strong code review loop |
| Embedding in a larger C++ ecosystem | C++ with gradual safe patterns | Interop bugs or duplicated abstractions | Interop cost may dominate |

That is the right shape of the decision: environment, constraints, and team capability matter as much as language choice.

## 15. Limits of This Comparison

These examples are intentionally small. Real codebases are larger, older, and messier.

- Rust still has `unsafe`
- disciplined C++ teams with sanitizers in CI can be very safe
- tooling quality matters
- ecosystem maturity matters
- team expertise matters
- this article does not turn the local performance snapshot into a universal benchmark
- this article does not measure compile time, tail latency across many workloads, or all binary-size tradeoffs

:::important
The point is not to simplify the world. The point is to choose the default that makes the dangerous path harder to take by accident.
:::

Modern C++ and Rust are converging toward the same operational goal: reducing catastrophic memory failures in systems software. The difference is where the enforcement lives. Modern C++ relies on increasingly sophisticated tooling, safer APIs, code review discipline, and organizational process. Rust moves more of that enforcement into the compiler and type system itself. Neither approach removes engineering tradeoffs, but they change when and where failures are discovered.
